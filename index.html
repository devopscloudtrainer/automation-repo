Branch is nothing but an logical directory which contains files/directories with associated commits.
Every branch will have unique data.

eg: Ecommerce-website:
      * login-feature
      * logout-feature
      * payment-feature
      * product-catalog
      * Add-to-cart feature

 Branch: ecommerce-website-branch
      * login-feature -> 20 files -> commits
      * logout-feature -> 10 files -> commits
      * payment-feature -> 30 files -> commits
      * product-catalog -> 50 files -> commits
      * Add-to-cart feature -> 10 files -> commits

Payment-feature: Has some problem - some changes are not working
                 They want to remove payment feature and re-develop again.

    Problem:
      * Difficult to rollback
      * Testing individual is an challenge
      * No reuseability concept.
